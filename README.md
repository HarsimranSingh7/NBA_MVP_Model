To predict the NBA MVP, it is important to understand the voting system for the award. Instead of approaching it as a classification problem, where the options are MVP or not-MVP, it is better to approach it as a regression problem. The target variable for the regression is the MVP Share, which is calculated by dividing the points obtained by a player by the maximum total possible points that could be obtained that year. This value ranges from 0 to 1, and the player with the highest MVP Share is predicted to be the MVP by the model.


The study used individual statistics such as average statistics per game, total statistics, and advanced statistics, as well as team placement and winning percentage, and MVP Share. In total, 71 variables were used for each player. Data from the 2006-07 seasons onwards were used, totaling 16 seasons. The data was collected from Basketball Reference for all players who played at least 1 minute in the season.

To narrow down the number of players and filter out those who are unlikely to win the MVP award, minimum criteria were established based on the lowest averages and statistics by an MVP in history. These criteria included a minimum number of games played, points per game, field goal attempts, rebounds, assists, field goal percentage, minutes played, making the playoffs, and not being traded midway through the season. Using these criteria, the majority of players were filtered out, leaving only 20 to 30 per season.

Several regression models were used, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Elastic Net, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM). The performance of each model was evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R²). The 2021-22 season was set aside for testing, while the remaining 15 seasons were used for training.

SVM, Random Forest, and LGBM had the lowest RMSE values and highest R² values. AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting also had adequate results, while Elastic Net had the worst metrics among the models used. Five of the six models correctly predicted Nikola Jokić as the MVP.

SHAP Values were used to visualize which variables had the greatest impact on the model's predictions. For example, in the SVM model, which had the best metrics, a chart showed the 20 variables with the greatest impact on the model. Each point represented a player, with a color gradient from red to blue indicating low to high values for each variable. The X-axis showed the obtained SHAP values, with more positive values indicating a greater positive impact on the MVP Share.

The three most impactful individual variables in the model were PER (Player Efficiency Rating), WS/48 (Win Shares per 48 minutes), and BPM (Box Plus-Minus). The two collective variables, Seed and PCT (percentage of wins), were also among the most impactful. Advanced statistics were more predominant than common statistics, with 7 of the 11 most important variables being advanced statistics. Of the three most popular statistics (points, rebounds, and assists per game), only points per game appeared on the list.

The model performed well in determining the MVP, correctly predicting 12 out of the last 16 MVPs. However, there was a drop in the RMSE and R² metrics, which may be due to the natural variation of the criteria for the award over time. In only 3 seasons did most models miss the MVP: 2016-17, 2010-11, and 2007-08. One factor that may have contributed to these misses is the low seed of the team, which is one of the most impactful variables on the result.

The study of the MVP award and the creation of a model to predict the next MVP proved to be very interesting and informative. The models were effective in predicting the MVP, with SVM having the best performance in the most recent season and Gradient Boosting having the best performance in older seasons. However, there is always room for improvement, and more variables could be added to the model, such as seasons of NBA experience, draft pick number, physical information, and the number of MVPs already won. This could help address issues such as voter fatigue.
